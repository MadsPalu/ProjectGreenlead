Expansion of Buksefjorden hydropower plant</h3><p class="text">The capital of Greenland, Nuuk, gets its electricity from the Buksefjord's hydroelectric power plant. Since 2010, there has been too little water. It requires a 16 km tunnel and enables the plant to be upgraded with 55 MW from 45 MW to 100 MW. After the project, Nuuk will be fossil-free throughout the energy and heating sectors, with room for energy-heavy industry.</p><p class="text">Parts of what we did:</p><div class="sectionGrid"><div class="sectionGridItem"><p class="gridNumber">01.</p><p class="gridText">Business case for the expasion</p></div><div class="sectionGridItem"><p class="gridNumber">02.</p><p class="gridText">Calculations and marketing to consumers</p></div><div class="sectionGridItem"><p class="gridNumber">03.</p><p class="gridText">Political presen-tations and articles for press</p></div></div></div><div class="gain"><p class="gridNumber">Gain</p><p class="gridText">Expected 1.7 billion DKK.

Solar cells and batteries for city supply</h3><p class="text">Greenland's small settlements have an energy requirement that is not much greater than 100 kW. Stand-alone solar cell systems with batteries have proven to be a solution that can reduce the use of diesel on the power plant's diesel-generator sets. So far, there have been 10 settlements with this type of installation. With a battery for the balancing, the diesel generators extend their lifetime up to 100%.

National single price for electricity & water (Greenland )</h3><p class="text">Based on a political ambition for equal prices for electricity and water in Greenland, and the goal to lower prices, 6 different price models were developed for political decision-making. The adopted model lowered national prices by an average of 28% and<b>channeled</b> 1% of Greenland's GDP to the population as a price reduction. The model financed via optimization, cost reductions, loan restructuring and public subsidies that are being phased out.

Process optimization</h3><p class="text">We were to optimise the process in data capture from remote consumption meters. One of the world's first national remote meter networks, by 2019 was all bugged up, and the number of unread meters exceeded 10%. The lost work time, the number of customer errors and the frustrations with the system had reached its limit. Project 1% was formed, and over a period of 24 months, the number of unread meters was brought from 10% to 1%. A department was built for meter handling and the preparation for the next system upgrade to DKK 200 million was implemented.</p><p class="text">Parts of what we did:</p><div class="sectionGrid"><div class="sectionGridItem"><p class="gridNumber">01.</p><p class="gridText">Top level management of team</p></div><div class="sectionGridItem"><p class="gridNumber">02.</p><p class="gridText">Establishment of project scope and supplier involvement.</p></div><div class="sectionGridItem"><p class="gridNumber">03.</p><p class="gridText">Ensuring continuous organizational focus among 50 employees.</p></div></div></div><div class="gain"><p class="gridNumber">Gain</p><p class="gridText">Reduction of unread from 10% of 60,000 meters to just 1%.<br><br>Reduction of monthly man hours corresponding to 4 full-time positions.<br><br>Error clarifications which increased revenue and profit by 2 million DKK yearly.</p></div></section><hr class="longHr"><section class="previosProjectsTextFlex"><div class="previousProjectsText"><h3>05. Setting up corporate governance</h3><p class="text">Annual budgeting of construction budget pools which were massively of target. Payment default imminent, employees were stressed, priorities were opaque and haphazard, some regions were starved while others had too many resources. The problems with the lack of management were many and had to be cleaned up. A new governance structure was created, which allocated the responsibility to the employees closer to the plants, and a precise framework was set, with a continuous full overview. Any overruns or underruns were carried over to the next year, making incentives to hit one's budget strong.</p><p class="text">Parts of what we did:</p><div class="sectionGrid"><div class="sectionGridItem"><p class="gridNumber">01.</p><p class="gridText">Systematic decision making</p></div><div class="sectionGridItem"><p class="gridNumber">02.</p><p class="gridText">Systematic decision making</p></div><div class="sectionGridItem"><p class="gridNumber">03.</p><p class="gridText">Implementation and ensuring ongoing operation</p></div></div></div><div class="gain"><p class="gridNumber">Gain</p><p class="gridText">Total control of cash flow year by year, better prioritization, adherence to budget, transparent prioritization, empowerment of local managers.</p></div></section><div class="furtherInfoBox"><p class="furtherInfoText">For further information & arrangement</p><a href="mailto: info@GreenLead.dk" class="emailBtn">Send Mail</a></div><h2>Practical information</h2><hr class="longHr"><footer><div><p>CVR number is 43467697</p><p>Account number is: 6471-2120329</p><p>Bank: Bank of Greenland (GrÃ¸nlandsbanken)</p><p>SWIFT: GRENGLGX</p><br></div><div><p>Our address is:</p><p>Oxford garden 291</p><p>2300 Copenhagen S</p><p>Denmark</p><br></div><div><p>Phone: +45 9360 5432</p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/greenlead-dk/"><svg width="27" height="25" viewBox="0 0 27 25" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M24.6066 0H1.8869C0.845852 0 0 0.809152 0 1.80246V23.1975C0 24.1908 0.845852 25 1.8869 25H24.6066C25.6477 25 26.4994 24.1908 26.4994 23.1975V1.80246C26.4994 0.809152 25.6477 0 24.6066 0ZM8.00898 21.4286H4.08139V9.49777H8.01489V21.4286H8.00898ZM6.04518 7.8683C4.78528 7.8683 3.76789 6.9029 3.76789 5.71987C3.76789 4.53683 4.78528 3.57143 6.04518 3.57143C7.29917 3.57143 8.32248 4.53683 8.32248 5.71987C8.32248 6.90848 7.30509 7.8683 6.04518 7.8683ZM22.7315 21.4286H18.8039V15.625C18.8039 14.2411 18.7744 12.4609 16.7633 12.4609C14.7166 12.4609 14.4031 13.9676 14.4031 15.5246V21.4286H10.4756V9.49777H14.2434V11.1272H14.2967C14.8231 10.1897 16.1067 9.20201 18.0172 9.20201C21.9922 9.20201 22.7315 11.6741 22.7315 14.8884V21.4286Z" fill="white" fill-opacity="0.5"/></svg></a></div></footer><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.2/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha384-OERcA2EqjJCMA+/3y+gxIOqMEjwtxJY7qPCqsdltbNJuaOe923+mo//f6V8Qbsw3" crossorigin="anonymous"></script></body></html>
