                </h3>
            <p class="text">The capital of Greenland, Nuuk, gets its electricity from the Buksefjord's hydroelectric power plant. Since 2010, there has been too little water. It requires a 16 km tunnel and enables the plant to be upgraded with 55 MW from 45 MW to 100 MW. 
                After the project, Nuuk will be fossil-free throughout the energy and heating sectors, with room for energy-heavy industry.</p>

            </h3>
        <p class="text">Greenland's small settlements have an energy requirement that is not much greater than 100 kW. Stand-alone solar cell systems with batteries have proven to be a solution that can reduce the use of diesel on the power plant's diesel-generator sets. So far, there have been 10 settlements with this type of installation. With a battery for the balancing, the diesel generators extend their lifetime up to 100%. So it's a good investment.</p>

        <h3>03. National single price for electricity & water (Greenland )
        </h3>
    <p class="text">Based on a political ambition for equal prices for electricity and water in Greenland, and the goal to lower prices, 6 different price models were developed for political decision-making. The adopted model lowered national prices by an average of 28% and<b>channeled</b>  1% of Greenland's GDP to the population as a price reduction. The model financed via optimization, cost reductions, loan restructuring and public subsidies that are being phased out. The pricing model came into force in 2018 and is still in use.</p>

        <h3>04. Process optimization  
        </h3>
    <p class="text">We were to optimise the process in data capture from remote consumption meters.
        One of the world's first national remote meter networks, by 2019 was all bugged up, and the number of unread meters exceeded 10%. The lost work time, the number of customer errors and the frustrations with the system had reached its limit. Project 1% was formed, and over a period of 24 months, the number of unread meters was brought from 10% to 1%. A department was built for meter handling and the preparation for the next system upgrade to DKK 200 million was implemented.</p>

        <h3>05. Setting up corporate governance 
        </h3>
    <p class="text">Annual budgeting of construction budget pools which were massively of target. Payment default imminent, employees were stressed, priorities were opaque and haphazard, some regions were starved while others had too many resources.
        The problems with the lack of management were many and had to be cleaned up.
        A new governance structure was created, which allocated the responsibility to the employees closer to the plants, and a precise framework was set, with a continuous full overview. Any overruns or underruns were carried over to the next year, making incentives to hit one's budget strong.</p>
