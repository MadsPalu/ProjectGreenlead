        <p class="text">We can help your company find the right hydropower project, facilitate or design an offtake

            Greenland is in many ways full of fantastic economic opportunities.
            <br>
            ​<br>
            In Greenland, 66 different hydropower potentials have been cataloged on the Greenlandic west coast, with
            hydrological data from the 70s. We have a great deal of knowledge of these potentials, as well as the many
            conditions that one should become familiar with in relation to geography and geology, glacial influence,
            submarine cables and transmission, population proximity, sales opportunities, local competences for
            operation and side industries, and much more.
            ​<br>
            ​<br>
            GreenLead has extensive knowledge of the political process that precedes exploration permits and
            exploitation permits, as well as how the dialogue around Impact Benefit Analysis (IBA) is approached, so
            that both Greenland and the Investor achieve the greatest possible success.
            <br>
            ​<br>
            One of the reasons we know so much is: we have established businesses and been citizens in Greenland for
            several years from 2012 - 2021, whereby we gained a great deal of knowledge of the business environment, the
            culture, local contacts, logistics, ice situations, the Greenland terrain and much more which is absolutely
            essential for running a business in Greenland.
            <br>
            ​<br>
            For the past 5 years, the team behind GreenLead have worked to realize hydropower investments in Greenland.
            This has resulted in the political approval and funding of 4 hydropower plants in the Greenlandic parliament
            from 0.2 MW to 55 MW in effect size - an infrastructure package of approx. 3.1 billion DKK.

            In other words electrification of gas and oil, via magnesium stone in a heating battery solution.
            <br>
            <br>
            If your company needs to change from gas and oil to an electric solution, we can help you.
            We offer turnkey solutions, with changes to process plants and heating centrals which are connected to a
            heating battery where the heart consists of magnesium stone.
            <br>
            <br>
            The plant is ideal for both process heat up to 700 degrees, as well as central heating systems in companies
            or district heating networks for utility companies.
            The plant can be dimensioned to take over all heat supply, or function as a supplement to other solutions.
            ​<br>
            <br>
            The efficiency with standard insulation is 95% return of energy, with a daily loss of about 1%. With greater
            insulation, the loss can be further reduced.
            ​<br>
            <br>
            The profitability of the plants is quite good, and most often you will experience a cheaper energy solution
            than gas or oil-based energy. Before each project, a profitability analysis is carried out, so that you know
            the economic conditions, as well as the prices of gas, oil, and electricity, which are the basis for
            positive profitability of the plant.
            ​<br>
            <br>
            GreenLead can also help with leasing arrangements for the facilities, as well as a service and maintenance
            agreement with guaranteed uptime.

            We help you with technical analysis, financial analysis, project management, supplier contact, setup,
            testing, and subsequent impact evaluations.
            Is your company considering changing its footprint on the climate and energy front?
            Are you in doubt as to what gives the most impact in terms of investment? And if you think it could be good
            to invest in energy optimization that gives an economic return, read on.
            ​<br>
            <br>
            At GreenLead, we have worked with green energy transition since 2001. Even before it became really popular.
            First in wind power, then hydropower, as well as solar, batteries, waste-to-energy, insulation of facades,
            and more. In terms of size, we have worked with plants of 30 kW up to 100 MW, and we can scale higher as
            needed.
            ​<br>
            <br>
            We would like to put that knowledge at your company's disposal, so that we can design comprehensive
            solutions that examine the relevance of all technologies concerning your company and your needs, taking into
            account your electricity agreements, gas agreements, tax conditions, etc. We can create comprehensive
            solutions together with you, which both optimize, restructure and even extract CO2 from your possible
            process plant so that your climate footprint is as small as is economically feasible or beyond.

            We help you with technical analysis, financial analysis, project management, supplier contact, setup,
            testing, and subsequent impact evaluations.
            Is your company considering changing its footprint on the climate and energy front?
            Are you in doubt as to what gives the most impact in terms of investment? And if you think it could be good
            to invest in energy optimization that gives an economic return, read on.
            ​<br>
            <br>
            At GreenLead, we have worked with green energy transition since 2001. Even before it became really popular.
            First in wind power, then hydropower, as well as solar, batteries, waste-to-energy, insulation of facades,
            and more. In terms of size, we have worked with plants of 30 kW up to 100 MW, and we can scale higher as
            needed.
            ​<br>
            <br>
            We would like to put that knowledge at your company's disposal, so that we can design comprehensive
            solutions that examine the relevance of all technologies concerning your company and your needs, taking into
            account your electricity agreements, gas agreements, tax conditions, etc. We can create comprehensive
            solutions together with you, which both optimize, restructure and even extract CO2 from your possible
            process plant so that your climate footprint is as small as is economically feasible or beyond.
